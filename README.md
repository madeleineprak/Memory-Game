# Memory-Game

This is an memory game where the user's goal is to click a unique image each time to get the most points. If you click a "repeated" card, your score resets to zero. The user can also utilize the input form to choose what pictures they want to see powered from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers). Try the deployed version [here](https://madeleineprak.github.io/Memory-Game/).

## Technologies Used
* React
* Unsplash API
* Bulma
* bulma-toast

## How It Works
1. Optional: Choose a term to set the theme of your game.
2. Click an image to score a point. Each new image clicked earns you a point and clicking an image that was already clicked previously sets the score back to zero.
3. See your score reflected in the progress bar under the Hero or in the bottom right corner. See how many points you can get!
